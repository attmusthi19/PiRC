# Pi Launchpad: Predictable Liquidity & Immediate-Utility Token Launches

**Pi Launchpad** introduces a fair, transparent, community-first and enagement-oriented token launch framework built natively on the Pi ecosystem.  It allows Pi holders to **stake** Pi (and/or maintain long-term lockups) to participate in new token launches, ensuring **predictable liquidity pool depth**, **fair unlock schedules**, and **alignment between communities and projects**.

Unlike traditional launchpads, Pi Launchpad never transfers the proceeds of a token launch sale to the project team — instead, **all Pi sold becomes liquidity**, supporting long-term market depth and trust.


## 1. Vision
The Pi ecosystem thrives on collaboration, transparency, and user empowerment.  Pi Launchpad continues that vision by enabling projects to do the same –– launch tokens, acquire users, reward users for their engagement and distribute tokens **with significantly reduced speculation-driven volatility or rug-pull risks**.

### Product-First Launches (Immediate Utility)
Unlike many token launches where the token launch precedes the product, **Pi Launchpad is designed for projects that already have a working product/app**. This matters because:
- **Engagement signals are real**: the participation window measures in-app registration and milestones against an actual product.
- **Tokens are usable immediately**: after TGE/market opening, the token can be used right away for its intended utility (e.g., in-app access, payments, rewards, governance), rather than being purely speculative.

Pi Launchpad aims to provide:
- **Fair access to the community** through staking-based participation and well-defined participation caps.
- **Instant Web3 scale and a global user base** for projects looking to acquire users for their real products and leverage the benefits of utility and governance tokens.
- **Predictable liquidity** anchored in Pi.
- **Unlock schedules** that align project and community interests.
- **On-chain transparency** of the launch process ensured by immutable smart contracts.
