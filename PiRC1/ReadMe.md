# PRC1: Pi Ecosystem Token Design (Pi Request for Comment)

This repository presents the Ecosystem Token Design for Pi Network as a Pi Request for Comment (PRC). Given the foundational role of ecosystem tokens within the Pi ecosystem and the new approaches introduced here, this design is shared openly to enable community review, discussion, and iterative improvement.

It currently contains two alternative designs: Design 1 and Design 2, which differ in Section 4 and 5, which define the way tokens are allocated to participants. Keep in mind these designs intentionally differ from existing models to address Web3 token issues explained previously, and the design is meant to align tokens as a powerful feature of Web3 with the creation of the real-world products and innovations, drawing on the existing strength and resources of Pi Network. 

Community feedback is an essential part of this process.  Feedback is welcome, and Pioneers are encouraged to review, comment, discuss with other community members and share specific suggestions on specific sections of the design through GitHub Issues, discussions, or Pull Requests. For those who do not have a GitHub account, please submit high-level feedback via the Google Form here.   

Pi will review and consider community input from GitHub and high-level feedback submitted through the Google Form. As with any design process, not all suggestions will be adopted, but feedback will be evaluated to determine whether and what adjustments are appropriate. The designs are also subject to further revisions based on feedback from the projects that want to participate in the launch program.
